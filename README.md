# Title Of the project - Order summary card solution

## Overview

~ This is an order summary card containing bill amount and an option for payment and canceling order.

## My process

~ I started building summary card first later i placed it in the center of the screen. In this building card is the real task to do. I created this by using "flex". The Order summary card contains about what you are paying for. Along with that i added payment details like bill amount. Finally, i added two buttons using flex in column direction.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flex

### What I learned

I got clear idea about how FLEX works. I understand how to import font, styling the button.
